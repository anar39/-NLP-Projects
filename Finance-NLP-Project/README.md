The project aimed to analyze quarterly earnings calls, focusing on the company's opening speech, forecasted and actual earnings per share, and the question-and-answer session. By examining these datasets, the goal was to gain insights into communication patterns, sentiment, and the impact of financial performance on investor interactions.

The project utilized NLP and text mining methodologies, with all code written in R.
